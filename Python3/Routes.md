# Programming routes

## Programming Logic

- [ ] Even or Odd
  - Problem: Write a program that prints whether a number is even or odd.
  - Objective: Practice using conditionals.

- [ ] Sum of Numbers
  - Problem: Write a program that asks the user for 10 numbers and then prints the sum of those numbers.
  - Objective: Work with loops, user input, and accumulation of values.

- [ ] Factorial of a Number

  - Objective: Work with strings and dictionaries.

- [ ] Caesar Cipher
  - Problem: Write a program that encrypts or decrypts a message using the Caesar cipher.
  - Objective: Practice working with strings and encryption algorithms.

- [ ] Hannoi Tower
  - Problem: Write a program that solves the Tower of Hanoi puzzle for n disks.
